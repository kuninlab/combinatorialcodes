# combinatorialcodes

Python package for combinatorial codes[1]. Allows creation of convex codes from specified place fields, computation of canonical form, and various operations with morphisms. Can also translate some of these things into algebraic terms.

This is currently in development. If you want to try it out you can install it with

`pip install git+https://github.com/kuninlab/combinatorialcodes.git`
